# CompanyKiosk
Company Kiosk is a non-interactive display only kiosk application to display company event listings, photos, and announcements to both visitors to the company office as well as staff internally.

In addition to the company specific information, also presented is the company address, today's date & time along with the current weather conditions.

Due to company privacy, weather conditions are pulled from secure PHP based middleware API.

To allow for easy updates from the company, configuration data of all events, photos, etc., are all pulled from a remote hosted configuration file. This allows for easy updates to the application without having to re-build the application.

Company Kiosk application is otherwise deployed on Raspberry Pi units tied via HDMI to various display systems throughout the building.
